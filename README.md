# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-
This project focuses on the detection and classification of lung cancer using both traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques and advanced Deep Learning (DL) models. The primary objective is to accurately identify three types of lung conditions from CT scan images: Normal, Benign, and Malignant cases.
